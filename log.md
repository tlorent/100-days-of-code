# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 5 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Recreated the To-Do List Project from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Course.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the CSS part, to transition the trash icons. Other than that, I managed to recreate all the other functionalities in the app.

### Day 2: June 6 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: Got some work done on the header, looks much better now. Added a logo, some dynamic typing. Pleased with the result. Also made some sketches and thought of what content to put in each section. Can't wait to continue!

### Day 3: June 7 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter.

**Thoughts** Got stuck on some logic, need to fix that next time. Learned some new jQuery things and got more experience in searching for solutions on StackOverflow.

### Day 4: June 8 2017

**Today's Progress**: Improved the Celsius to Fahrenheit converter.

**Thoughts** Encountered a strange bug, need to look into that the next time. Made slow progress today, for my next hour of code I need to write down what I need to get done for the project and write more pseudo to think about the code I'm going to write. Slightly frustrated today.

### Days 5-6: June 9/10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Celsius to Fahrenheit converter, worked through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

**Thoughts** Fixed the temperature converter, added some functionalities such as showing images that correspond to certain temperature ranges. Also worked my way through the Front-End fCC curriculum, HTML, CSS, jQUery. Went well!

### Day 7: June 11 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

**Thoughts** Not all assignments/challenges went well, had some difficulties. When I was building the Movie Game a few months ago, my JavaScript was much better. It has become a little rusty, so it is really good practice to work through the JavaScript section of the freeCodeCamp.

### Day 8: June 12 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the JavaScript & OOP section of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, as well as made a start with the NodeJS part of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp.

**Thoughts** Need to write more pseudo before writing any code, needs to become more of a habit. Big part of the JS curriculum is going well.

### Day 9-13: June 13-17 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the Basic Algorithm Scripting section of the fCC curriculum. Worked through eight challenges.

**Thoughts** Writing more pseudo definitely helped, sometimes this meant that the code worked instantly. Feel like I'm not making a lot of progress, would like to make a better schedule.
